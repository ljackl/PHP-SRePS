Daily Standup for [Group 01 / PHP-SRePS / Sprint 1]

Date: 04/08/18


Talking Points

=========================================

Things I've done
 
 - Attempted to create a model (this is required for my controller I assume).
 - Still am yet to run through more of the document, possibly after asking what is required to complete my work.

Things that were blocking me
 - More things unrelated to uni.

Still working on
 - The controller, possibly a model that I can use myself also.
 - Returning to a decent workflow after disruptions.

Plan on doing
 - Creating a controller, and learning on doing so, what requires it and what can use it / what it does. **Still stands.
 - Learning what may be required in order to make a controller.

General Status
 - A little lost, need more communication and understanding.
